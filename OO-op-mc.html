    <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Eminence in the Shadow tells the story of a high school student named Minoru Kagenou who gets transported to a different world after being hit by a truck.
    
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite his unassuming appearance, Minoru Kagenou (who is now known as Cid) possesses a powerful ability known as “Eminence” that allows him to control and manipulate shadows.

The Eminence in the Shadow is a bit different compared to other anime of this genre. The main character is an overpowered individual who boasts not only incredible physical strength but also exceptional intelligence and strategic thinking. However, what sets him apart from others is their strong desire to avoid being in the spotlight and maintain a low profile.
<br>
<br>
There is also a whole new level of misunderstanding going on in Cid’s world as the seemingly fake Diablo cult he created turns out to be true. His army of minions (comprised entirely of femme fatale who worship him) trust his word and fight the Diablo cult, however to Cid, all of these are just made up stories and it makes for an interesting read.

As Cid navigates through the challenges, he discovers that his abilities are not just a blessing but also a curse, as he is targeted by a secret organization that wants to harness his powers for their own gain.
<br>
<br>
Despite being an overpowered main character, Minoru Kagenou is a relatable protagonist who struggles with his own identity and the weight of his abilities. The animation is visually stunning, with the use of shadows and lighting adding to the atmosphere of the show.

But as she becomes unbeatable in battle, she attracts the attention of other players and guilds.
            
            As previously stated, this anime provides a unique plot with an overpowered main character, as well as humor and commentary on the gaming community. The show also does a great job of exploring the concept of power and the consequences that come with it,
            <br>
            <br>
            Kaede’s unique approach to the game and her interactions with her friends and rivals will have you laughing and rooting for her as she takes on tougher challenges. It’s a light-hearted and entertaining watch that’s perfect for any fan of gaming or anime with op main characters.

                But here’s the twist: the alien teacher, Koro-sensei, isn’t the villain of the story. Instead, he’s a lovable and charismatic character who is dedicated to helping his students become strong and capable assassins.
                
                This might sound like a strange premise, but trust us, it’s a lot of fun.
                <br>
                <br>
                Assassination Classroom subverts expectations and challenges traditional notions of what it means to be a hero or a villain. Koro-sensei is an overpowered character, but instead of using his powers for evil, he uses them to teach and mentor his students. In fact, he challenges them all to become powerful enough to assassinate him, which is a breath of fresh air when it comes to anime with op main characters.

The show is packed with action, humour, and heart. The students are all unique and likable, and their growth throughout the series is a real treat to watch. But the real star of the show is the alien teacher, who is equal parts terrifying and endearing. His backstory and motivations are revealed slowly over time, and they are truly fascinating.
<br>
<br>
You would think that a story about a group of students trying to kill their teacher would be dark and gritty, but you’ll find that this anime has a surprise or two in store for you. And the fact that the teacher is an overpowered character makes it all the more exciting.

                <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Slime is one of the popular titles in this genre featuring overpowered main characters, and does not need any special introduction.

                    The story follows the journey of Satoru Mikami, a 37-year-old man who is reincarnated as a slime in a fantasy world. The anime is set in a fantasy world where the main character, Rimuru Tempest, the reincarnation of Satoru Mikami, is a slime.
                    
                    However, don’t let the slime’s cute appearance fool you as he turns out to be one of the most overpowered beings over the course of the story.

                        <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Let’s be honest; we all know we expected One Punch Man to be here on the list, and it’s not surprising that One Punch Man is second on our anime with OP MC list.

                            The story follows the journey of Saitama, an overpowered hero who can defeat any opponent with a single punch. But despite his incredible strength, Saitama is bored with his lack of challenge and sets out to find a worthy opponent.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The show is filled with over-the-top battles and hilarious moments that will have you laughing and cheering at the same time. Saitama’s deadpan delivery and complete lack of interest in his own power make for a comedic contrast to his enemies’ overconfidence.

One Punch Man is a parody of the typical shonen anime, with its main character being so overpowered that he can defeat any enemy in one punch, making the show a hilarious satire of the genre.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, the series also has a great cast of characters, including Saitama’s cyborg apprentice Genos, the ninja Speed-o’-Sound Sonic, and the powerful S-class heroes of the Hero Association.

The animation is top-notch, and the humour is spot-on. With its unique take on the typical action anime, One Punch Man is a must-watch for fans of the genre and newcomers alike.

Saitama, the main character of the series is always compared with Goku of Dragon Ball and fans debate about who is stronger than who all the time. However, many believe that there are several characters in Dragon Ball who can defeat Saitama and they are not part of the God pantheon in the series.

                            <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">The title that takes the top spot in our list of anime with OP main character is none other than The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.

                                This anime follows Kusuo Saiki, a high school student with psychic abilities that could make him one of the strongest characters out there. But instead of using his powers to save the world or defeat enemies, Kusuo just wants to live a normal life and avoid attention. All Saiki wants to do is get through high school without any drama.
                                
                                There are a couple of reasons why this anime tops the list for us. The first being Saiki’s ridiculous psychic abilities, which make him an almost omnipotent being. From mind reading and teleporting, to bending space-time and spawning/destroying entire universes (without his limiters), Saiki clearly is the most powerful protagonist in this list.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The second is the fact that the anime is once again something that avoids all the cliches and gives us a heart-warming and extremely funny narrative. Saiki K also has a relatable theme of acceptance and fitting in, which is a nice change of pace from the usual “save the world” trope.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Its take on the anime with overpowered main character trope is fresh and hilarious, and the relatable themes and well-written characters make it a must-watch for any anime fan.
