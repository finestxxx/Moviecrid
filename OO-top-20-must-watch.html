    <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">The Fog Hill of the Five Elements is a 2020 donghua that had been in the making since 2017. It took this long for the Chinese anime to be released due to the fact that it was originally worked by a small number of people, and it’s a good thing that Nice Boat Animation (which recently released their anime series: White Cat Legend last April 10).


        The story is about various people who can use the five elements in Chinese legends, and the ensuing in the anime is truly ecstatic for the eyes to see</p>

        <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Psychic Princess or Tong Ling Fei is a 2018-2019 shoujo Chinese anime that invaded the donghua community with its addicting opening theme and interesting story. It is more like a romantic-comedy series but there are fight scenes in the anime that falls into the martial-arts genre and these scenes were really done pretty well.
            The romance donghua is in the boundary of action, comedy, romance, satire, and parody which makes the entire journey of watching it entertaining. It runs for a total of 16 episodes so far, although fans are expecting Psychic Princess Season 2 to be green-lit soon, especially since its 16th episode (finale) is such a big cliffhanger.

            <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">If you’re looking for an anime like Soul Land or Battle Through the Heavens but in 2D style, then The Grand Lord is a must-watch for you. It is the final installment of the novel trilogy on which Battle Through the Heavens, and Martial Universe were based from. The Grand Lord is inspired by the novel The Great Ruler and the anime premiered on August 8, 2019. As of writing, I am actually at the 8th episode of The Grand Lord and I could say that it has been a fun ride with good animation quality, solid fight scenes, and interesting Chinese anime cultivation cliché. 
                The Grand Lord is the only 2D anime in the trilogy as the other two (2) – Battle through the Heavens and Martial Universe were both made in 3DCG format. Nonetheless, it literally offers great fight scenes and beautiful scenery. I think my only complaint about The Grand Lord is the poor writing at some point in the show, as it feels like a rip-off of Lion King in some instances. Furthermore, some cliché was poorly written which I believed somehow affected the overall story implementation in the latter part of the anime.

                Nevertheless, The Grand Lord will be rebooted and is scheduled to get a 3D donghua adaptation in 2022 under its original title, The Great Ruler. It’ll be animated by Motion Magic, the same studio behind Battle Through the Heavens and Martial Universe; and will be produced by iQIYI as unveiled during their May 13, 2021 Conference.

                    <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Another shoujo anime in our list, it’s the closest anime that I could compare with the Psychic Princess and it is so hard to separate these two Chinese anime since they also aired in almost exactly the same time frame. The twist with The Demonic King Chases His Wife is that it’s an isekai anime, yes the isekai cliché which is very rampant in the Japanese animation industry. It’s a story about a professional assassin who traveled back in time or has been brought to another world after she was betrayed and stabbed by her then-lover. There, she experienced the life of another person, with respect to this plot; this actually reminds me of Soul Land and Battle Through the Heavens.
                        The Demonic King Chases His Wife is listed by our team as one of the best Chinese anime from the Winter 2019 lineup. One of its redeeming factors is the fact that its main heroine is an assassin and she’s not a damsel in distress – this plot though is very similar to the main heroine from Psychic Princess. The fight scenes in this anime are a little bit better compared to Psychic Princess but its story is quite weaker or has less substance than the latter</p>

                        <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Supernatural creatures in one boarding house? That is what we get from the Chinese anime Journal of Mysterious Creatures which is adapted from a manhua titled The Record of Unusual Creatures. The anime project is a combined work by both Japanese and Chinese animation companies and this could be seen easily in the animation quality of the series.

                            The Journal of Mysterious Creatures may not really be listed as martial arts or cultivation anime but I would like to include it in this list as the fight scenes are truly worth watching. Aside from the action, the anime also thrive in its entertaining humor and cliché supernatural plot which seems random and simple, and fun to follow</p>

                                        <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Here we have Martial Universe (Wu Dong Qian Kun), along with Battle Through the Heavens and The Great Ruler – they made up a trilogy and were all written by the same author. I am not a big fan of the story of Martial Universe; however, its anime adaptation is a solid one and definitely deserves praise. The anime had been released in January 2019 and run for a total of 12 episodes.
                                            Martial Universe is a great cultivation anime and it is really amazing to see that Chinese animation has stories of the main protagonist from the beginning until they become an overwhelming entity. This scenario actually reminds me of Naruto, Luffy from One Piece, and several protagonists from mainstream Shounen anime from Japan. However, Martial Universe is among the best Chinese anime that I had seen in 2019, plus its soundtrack was literally amazing and enthralling.

It may follow the same cliché as Martial Universe, The Grand Lord, Soul Land, and Battle Through the Heavens but it somehow offers a different approach to the same plot.
                                                I was quite skeptical when I first watch the anime last December 2018, however, it turns out to be a pretty decent ride with an obviously handsome main character (cough cough) which is also the same case with almost all the anime I had mentioned in the previous paragraph. Stellar Transformation, along with Battle Through the Heavens, and Martial Universe shared the same cliché of achieving enormous strength from the help of external power and later on assimilating it within themselves</p>

        <p class="otakus-page-item-writeup">Soul Land or Douluo Dalu is among my first Chinese anime series and it is an amazing one to watch especially the fight scenes and the world-setting of the anime as a whole. So far, only Soul Land and Battle Through the Heavens had entered deeper into my system and captured me with their interesting world and how everything works in it.
            Soul Land has the arena tournament feature in its story which makes the experience of watching it truly entertaining and exciting. We have the main protagonists and his friends set on a battle in the arena to gain battle experience while slowly building their reputations as spiritualists. In this aspect, this reminds me of the classic Dragon Ball cliché, and the duo anime Yu Yu Hakusho and The Flame of Recca which I truly enjoyed from my childhood days.

            I think the only part of Soul Land that I am not really interested in is romance – a factor that I think is quite too much. Nonetheless, looking at the whole series in general, it is a great adventure anime that highlights friendship, family and surpasses one’s limit. In 2020, Soul Land is slated to release a live-action drama series starring Chinese actor Xiao Zhan as Tang San</p>

Battle Through the Heavens is based on a novel with the same title and it is the first Chinese web novel that I had finished reading. It’s a great ride I may say and if the anime will continue to cover the entire novel, I won’t have any complaint as long as they could give justice to it.
                The anime of Battle Through The Heavens have a total of 3 seasons in its league with the first season being quite a disappointment but did a good job of introducing its world-setting. The 2nd season had been a leap and gave us a satisfying show. Meanwhile, the 3rd season of the anime aired on July 21, 2019, and the increase in the animation quality is definitely noticeable. If you could survive the first season of this anime, I could definitely assure you that you’ll have a good treat to an amazing cultivation anime with Battle Through the Heavens</p>

Kind of easy since I have this friend who is quite addicted to shounen anime and The Legend and the Hero is among his most hyped and recommended anime to me. I actually have it on my watchlist but don’t have some spare time to watch it yet. However, based on available teasers and videos of the anime – this anime is a good one if we will simply talk about fight scenes. And since I am recommending martial arts and cultivation anime, I am strongly confident to recommend The Legend and the Hero because I am quite hyped to watch it too very soon</p>
